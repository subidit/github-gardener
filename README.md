			Hey everyone!

			The bot can now push automated pull requests, code reviews and issues!

			Plus, GitHub announced that private repositories are now available for everyone!

			That means you can now have a green contribution history and a diamond contribution chart, and no one can see the commits since they are made in a private repository.
